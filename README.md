# Button--Manipulation-of-Listeners
Manipulating a button from javax.swing.JButton 

This is a simple program. We create a button using javax.swing.JButton 
and manipulate its color when it's clicked or exited or hovered over etc.
At the end we'll have something like what we have in the illustration.
